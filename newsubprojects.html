<h1>New Subproject Process<a class="headerlink" href="#new-subproject-process" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Project Jupyter is organized as a set of Subprojects that are each a GitHub
repository with a development team that follows the Jupyter governance, license
and contribution model. Officially supported and maintained Subprojects are
hosted under the following GitHub organizations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter">github.com/jupyter</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyterhub">github.com/jupyterhub</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyterlab">github.com/jupyterlab</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-resources">github.com/jupyter-resources</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets">github.com/jupyter-widgets</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ipython">github.com/ipython</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This document describes the process by which new Subprojects are created in or
moved to these organizations from other locations. There are two ways that new
Subprojects are created:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="#direct-subproject-creation">Direct Subproject creation</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>e.g., when contributors to an existing Subproject decide to create a new
Git repository for related but separable code</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="#incorporation-of-an-existing-external-subproject">Incorporation of an existing external Subproject</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>e.g., when contributors to a project in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">github.com/jupyter-incubator</a>
submit a proposal for incorporation into one of the official Jupyter
organizations and receive approval from the Steering Council</p></li>
<li><p>e.g., when contributors to a third-party project submit an incorporation
proposal and receive approval from the Steering Council</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that projects in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">github.com/jupyter-incubator</a>
are <strong>not</strong> considered officially supported and maintained Subprojects until they
meet the criteria below and go through the incorporation process detailed later in
this document.</p>
<div class="section" id="criteria-for-official-subprojects">
<h2>Criteria for official Subprojects<a class="headerlink" href="#criteria-for-official-subprojects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The following criteria will be used in evaluating Subprojects for incorporation
into one of the official Jupyter organizations. These apply to any Subproject,
regardless of who is developing the Subproject. Subprojects should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have an active developer community that offers a sustainable model for future development.</p></li>
<li><p>Have an active user community.</p></li>
<li><p>Use solid software engineering with documentation and tests hosted with appropriate
technologies (<a class="reference external" href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read The Docs</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a>
are examples of technologies that can be used).</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate continued growth and development.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate well with other official Subprojects.</p></li>
<li><p>Be developed according to the Jupyter governance and contribution model that is documented
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/governance">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a well-defined scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Be packaged using appropriate technologies such as pip, conda, npm, bower, docker, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a general guideline, we support improving existing Subprojects over
incorporating competing Subprojects in the Project.</p>
<p>The most important question in evaluating Subprojects for incorporation as
official Subprojects is this: is there broad agreement in the community and
Steering Council that we are going to develop and maintain the Subproject in an
official capacity?</p>
<p>The two paths for official Subproject creation are now detailed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="direct-subproject-creation">
<h2>Direct Subproject creation<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-subproject-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>In some cases, Steering Council members can immediately create new official Subprojects in the main
Jupyter organization. This option will be used when the new Subproject is clearly part of the
existing scope, activities and development of Project Jupyter. The process for direct Subproject
creation is minimal and informal: Steering Council members should be in consensus about the
Subprojectâs creation and notify the main Jupyter list of its creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="incorporation-of-an-existing-external-subproject">
<h2>Incorporation of an existing external Subproject<a class="headerlink" href="#incorporation-of-an-existing-external-subproject" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>In other cases, Subprojects proposed for incorporation will have existed and been developed as
open-source software for some time outside the official Jupyter organizations. This section describes
the incorporation process for these existing external Subprojects. This process applies to
Subprojects that have incubated under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter-incubator</span></code> GitHub organization (see below),
Subprojects developed under other GitHub organizations, or Subprojects developed as open-source
software in other public venues.</p>
<p>When a Subproject is incorporated, it becomes an officially supported and maintained part
of Project Jupyter and is moved to one of the GitHub organizations noted at the top of
this document</p>
<div class="section" id="proposal-for-incorporation">
<h3>Proposal for incorporation<a class="headerlink" href="#proposal-for-incorporation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>For an existing external Subproject to be incorporated into one of the main Jupyter organizations,
the following proposal process will be used:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The Subproject team should submit a pull request against the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals">jupyter/enhancement-proposals</a> repository
with an enhancement proposal for including the Subproject in one of the main Jupyter organizations.
The enhancement proposal should describe how the Subproject meets each of the above criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposal for incorporation will be discussed by the community using that pull request.</p></li>
<li><p>A recommendation will be made by the consensus of the Steering Council (SC).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> the SC should make every effort to reach a decision promptly. If
there is active discussion and feedback about the proposal, that should be
allowed to proceed and voices be heard.  But to avoid unnecessary delays waiting for everyone to vote, the following guideline should be used:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>upon proposal, allow a week for potential objections (explicit agreement
welcome, of course). If no objections, treat silence as agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>if a month goes by and thereâs continued, active disagreement, that should be
treated as a strong signal that the project isnât ready to graduate (BDFL
pronouncement could still be used to make an acceptance call if judged
necessary).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The possible recommendations of the Steering Council will be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Integration into an existing official Suproject.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporation as a new official Subproject.</p></li>
<li><p>Further internal or external incubation (see below) with recommendations on steps the team can
take to prepare for future incorporation.</p></li>
<li><p>Rejection. This option will be used if the Steering Council thinks the proposed Subproject is not
progressing or will never be appropriate for incorporation. If a rejected Subproject has been
incubating under the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">jupyter-incubator</a> GitHub
organization, its repository will be removed from that organization after a transition period.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="incorporation">
<h3>Incorporation<a class="headerlink" href="#incorporation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>When an existing external Subproject is incorporated as a new official Subproject, the following
steps will be taken:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The repository will be transfered over to one of the main Jupyter GitHub organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>A GitHub team will be created for the Subproject, with the Subproject team having
read/write permissions on the Subproject repository.</p></li>
<li><p>The team will send an email to the main Jupyter list with an announcement about the new
Subproject.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/governance/master/projectlicense.md">Project Jupyter LICENSE</a> file that
is maintained in this governance repository will be added to the repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Copyright notices in individual files should be updated to the standard form described
in our <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/governance/master/projectlicense.md">Project Jupyter License</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="section" id="incubation-of-subprojects">
<h2>Incubation of Subprojects<a class="headerlink" href="#incubation-of-subprojects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Incubation refers to the process of a Subproject initially being developed outside the official
Jupyter organizations. Incubation is recommended for new Subprojects with the following
characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Significant unanswered technical questions or uncertainties that require exploration.</p></li>
<li><p>Entirely new directions, scopes or ideas that havenât been vetted with the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Significant, already existing code bases where it is not clear how the Subproject will
integrate with the rest of Jupyter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Incubation also allows the broader community to easily distinguish between stable, officially
supported and maintained Subprojects in the main GitHub organizations and new efforts that are
emerging and being developed for future inclusion.</p>
<p>If there are questions about whether incubation is appropriate for a given Subproject, interested
parties should simply start a discussion on the main Jupyter list to get community and Steering
Council feedback.</p>
<div class="section" id="incubation-in-the-jupyter-incubator-organization">
<h3>Incubation in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">jupyter-incubator</a> organization<a class="headerlink" href="#incubation-in-the-jupyter-incubator-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>If a Subproject team knows from the start that it would eventually like its Subproject to be part
of one of the official Jupyter organizations, it can be incubated in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">jupyter-incubator</a> organization.</p>
<p>The goals of the incubation in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">jupyter-incubator</a> organization are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Contributors can quickly and easily get their code exposed to the Jupyter community while
complying with individual and organizational contribution restrictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Contributors can work with the community and Steering Council and gather feedback early and often
that will help them develop and refine a clear and concise integration proposal.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the community to distinguish between officially supported Subprojects and experimental
Subprojects pursued by members of the community.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="repository-management-policy-for-incubator-projects">
<h4>Repository management policy for incubator projects<a class="headerlink" href="#repository-management-policy-for-incubator-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Projects may from time to time want to create new repositories to explore
various ideas.  The basic policy for this is the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the project is named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>, it can create new repositories named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo-X</span></code>
without asking for further authorization.  The project can decide whether to
announce the repo on the broader Jupyter channels or not if it thinks there
is sufficient interest (obviously these repos are still public and open to
participation by all).</p></li>
<li><p>If the project would like to create a repo named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> (a top-level name that
someone else might potentially be interested in), it should post to the main
Jupyter list.  The proposal will be discussed with the assumption that,
unless someone raises a serious objection, these requests will be approved as
propmptly as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposal-for-incubation">
<h3>Proposal for incubation<a class="headerlink" href="#proposal-for-incubation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>A Subproject team can initiate the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">jupyter-incubator</a>
incubation process by submitting a proposal for incubation. This process is designed to be
lightweight and quick:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The proposers must fill out an incubation application by sumitting a pull request to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/proposals">jupyter-incubator/proposals</a> repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposers must announce their intent to the community with a post to the main Jupyter
mailing list.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed Subproject must have an Advocate who is an active Steering Council member. The role
of the Advocate is to introduce the Subproject team to the Jupyter community and help them through
incubation processes. While the Advocate may be involved in the actual development and design
of the Subproject, that is not required.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposal for incubation will be discussed by the community and approved or rejected by
the consensus of the Steering Council.</p></li>
<li><p>If approved, the proposal pull request will be merged, if rejected, it will be closed.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="incubation-period">
<h3>Incubation period<a class="headerlink" href="#incubation-period" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Once a Subproject is approved for incubation in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">jupyter-incubator</a> organization, the following steps will be
taken:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>A GitHub repository will be created under the jupyter-incubator organization</p></li>
<li><p>A GitHub team will be created with read/write access to the repository, including the
Advocate.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard Jupyter <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/governance/master/projectlicense.md">LICENSE</a> file that
is maintained in this governance repository will be added to the new repository.</p></li>
<li><p>A member of the Steering Council will announce the newly incubated Subproject on the
main Jupyter list.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of the incubation period is to demonstrate that the Subproject is going to develop an
active developer and user community. There is no particular length of time required for incubation,
but it is expected that most Subprojects will be in incubation for at least six months to one year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="external-incubation">
<h2>External incubation<a class="headerlink" href="#external-incubation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Incubation outside the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator">jupyter-incubator</a> organization is also
possible. In this case, there is no formal process. Any individual or organization can simply create
a new project on their own personal GitHub (or other VCS) repository and develop it as they see fit.
If such an externally created and incubated Subproject wants to become part of the official Jupyter
organizations, the criteria listed at the top of this document must be satisfied and the same
incorporation process must be followed.</p>
